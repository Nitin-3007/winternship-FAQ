Starting my first ever internship, i wasn't very confident of what is expected of me. No clear roadmaps, No predefined end goals. Yet the first interaction with the professor is something i will remember my whole life-

> "A deer that over fears the tiger dies of thirst and the deer that under fears dies at the paws of the tiger".

I had more than 400 co-interns, the journey from being just one of them to knowing and being known to almost all of them was very exciting and helped me gain confidence on myself.

We started with 'ViBe'- which is the abbreviation of 'Vikram-Betal', a wonderful platform developed by Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design which makes sure that students dont lose focus on their learning by having small reel-like course videos and also strict monitoring. I had a great time learning on ViBe and within a week i had completed a full MERN course. Next we had to solve case studies which were quite challenging and eventually we started working on projects. 

No, I did not rank first in finishing ViBe neither did I excelled in Case studies but i shared whatever i knew to others who were falling behind and helped them rise. As the saying goes 

> I helped a man climb a mountain and found that I too had reached the top

yes i felt this when i was rewarded my Golden Ticket by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar Sir and his team. The Golden Ticket was never my goal in fact i didn't even know something like that existed when i started this internship. All i wanted to achieve was learn from others and also teach them what i knew, sharing of thoughts and ideas, knowing people. There is a quiet beauty in getting so caught up in the 'doing' that you forget to check the 'becoming.' I spent so much time leaning into others and sharing space in those rooms that I didn't see my small world expanding. To wake up and find my network so wide, so diverse, and so rich with connection is a gift I didn't know I was receiving. Seeing how big and diverse my network has become is a beautiful reminder of what happens when we truly show up for one other.

If someone asks me now about what was the most enjoyable part of this internship for me, I have no answer because I fell for the process and when you fall for something, you love and enjoy every part and aspect of it. From "Positive Vibes Only" morning standups and fun quizzes to late night planning of hackathon problem statements and eventually organizing a successful event. I enjoyed every bit of it. Now being on the last week of this internship journey I can confidently say every activity in this Winternship has taught me something which i will cherish throughout my life. It was the best first-ever-internship experience for me. 

A huge thank you to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and the entire team at Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design. Thank you for not just giving us a platform to code, but a space to grow, lead, and connect. I’m walking away with a Golden Ticket, but more importantly, I’m walking away with a mindset that I will carry for the rest of my career. It has been an honor to be part of this 'Winternship'!
